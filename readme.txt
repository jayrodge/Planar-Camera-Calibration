Keys:
-----
	1 - Extract Feature point and do Calibration.
	2 - Test the Calibration of test file.
	3 - Extract Feature point and test in cv.calibrateCamera.
	4 - Test the Calibration of noise by Applying RANSAC.
    h - help.
    q - quit the program.


Summary:
--------
This program implements a planar camera calibration algorithm under the assumption of noisy data. Robust estimation through RANSAC is used to eliminate outliers.
